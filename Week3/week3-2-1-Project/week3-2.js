/**
    * * Highlight: in this thing we will study fetch api and authentication and mongodb
    * ! Important: Cyrptography Jarong  in  authenticaiton are
    * ! Hashing
1. Hashing is one way 
2. Given the output, no one can find out the input 
3. Changing the input a lil bit changes the output by a lot

    * ! Encryption
1. Encryption is two way 
2. A string is encrypted using a password 
3. String can be decrypted using the same password 

    * ! Json web tokens
1. Its neither of encryption or hashing  
(its technically a digital signature) 
2. Anyone can see the original output given the signature 
3. Signature can be verified only using the password
Password
4. It takes json as an input it works in web and in 

    * ! Local Storage
A place in your browser where you can store some data 
Usually things that are stored include -  
1. Authentication tokens 
2. User language preference 
3. User theme preference

    * ! Databases
1. Express lets u create an HTTP server 
2. Jsonwebtokens library lets you create jets 
3. Mongoose lets you connect to your database

    * ! how to decide which is the better way of encrypting our data for our problem statement?
    * fmous algo for hashing and encryption aes 128 sha 256
    * crytojs
    * crypto.input("my string to encrupt").secret("asdfasdf")
    * ! Is there function to store anything in loacl storaga is provided by browser? yes localStorage.set ({abc:efg})
    * ! How is JWT verifying the users like what it compares with and how it verifies the signature?
    * ! cant we run mongodb on a local server for production level application?
    * ! is mongoose just like an orm for no sql databases?

    * 
    * ? Question: 
    * TODO todo:
