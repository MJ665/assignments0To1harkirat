can you discuss react query while data fetching and data caching instead of useEffect, shed some light on that

useswr -> a feature created by vercel 
import useSWR from 'swr'
 
 ```js
 import useSWR from 'swr'
 
function Profile() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)
 
  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (isLoading) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
 ```
